It is specific to the cuisines of Poland and Belarus, where it is known as żur or żurek (diminutive). A variant made with wheat flour instead of rye is known in Poland as barszcz biały (&quot;white borscht&quot;). Varieties of this soup are also found in the cuisines of other western Slavic nations such as Slovakia (kyslóvka) and Czech Republic (kyselo - with mushrooms and without meat)."/>
